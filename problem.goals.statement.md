# Fundraising / End of Year Goals and Problems

The current implementation is problematic and are misaligned w/ the over Library goal of More People Reading More. Lightboxes and Donate buttons are not performing. Lightboxes interrupt and annoy. Buttons are ignored and disregared. NYPL should use more current approaches and methods to attract new donors and contributors.

## Goals:

    * More People Reading more
	   * More people contributing more
		* Develop more effective pathways of giving
			 * fewer red buttons
			 * more contextual asks
				    * branch specific (LPA/Schomburg/Heiskell,???)
				* more unobtrusive asks
				* more accessible asks


## Problems:

Lightboxes are annoying, disruptive and cause accessibility issues that are complex and difficult to surmount.
Multiplicty of donate buttons causes a kind of blindness.
    * see Schomburg & LPA Location pages
    *
Is there parity & continuity from point of departing NYPL.org to Convio systems and back again?
    * Probably not, so work in that system will probably need to be done

## Pages to add to mix:

Blogs
best books pages

## Additional opportunities

Interstitials in podcasts, and as trailers on other audio recordings.
