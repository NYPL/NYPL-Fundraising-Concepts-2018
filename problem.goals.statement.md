# Fundraising / End of Year Goals and Problems

The current implementation is problematic and are misaligned w/ the over Library goal of More People Reading More. Lightboxes and Donate buttons are not performing. Lightboxes interrupt and annoy. Buttons are ignored and disregared. NYPL should use more current approaches and methods to attract new donors and contributors.

## Goals: 
	
    * More People Reading more
	   * More people contributing more
		* Develop more effective pathways of giving
			 * fewer red buttons
			 * more contextual asks
				    * branch specific (LPA/Schomburg/Heiskell,???)
				* more unobtrusive asks
				* more accessible asks


## Problems:

Lightboxes are annoying, disruptive and cause accessibility issues that are complex and difficult to fix.
Multiplicty of donate buttons causes a kind of blindness.
Is ther parity & continuity from nypl to convio systems?
